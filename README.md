# Python Projects

A collection of Python projects developed as part of my programming coursework. These programs demonstrate core problem-solving, clean code practices, and foundational programming concepts including control flow, functions, loops, and file I/O.

## Projects
- **Class Ranker** – Calculates and ranks students based on grade and GPA inputs.  
- **Date Validator** – Validates and formats user-entered dates.  
- **Dealership Menu (V1–V6)** – Iterative versions of a dealership management console app demonstrating modular design and menu-driven programming.  
- **Employee Bonus Calculator** – Calculates employee bonuses based on performance metrics.  
- **Sales & Profit Calculator** – Computes sales totals, profit margins, and tax adjustments.  
- **Sign Price Calculator** – Determines advertising sign pricing based on size, color, and quantity.  
- **Tax Calculator** – Estimates tax liabilities based on income brackets.  
- **authorized_vehicles.txt** – Sample dataset used for file I/O exercises.

## Technologies Used
